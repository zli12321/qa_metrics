QA-Evaluation-Metrics is a fast and lightweight Python package for evaluating question-answering models and prompting of black-box and open-source large language models. It provides various basic and efficient metrics to assess the performance of QA models. 

### Updates
- Uopdated to version 0.2.8 
  - Supports prompting OPENAI GPT-series models and Claude Series models now. (Assuimg OPENAI version > 1.0)
  - Supports prompting various open source models such as LLaMA-2-70B-chat, LLaVA-1.5 etc by calling API from [deepinfra](https://deepinfra.com/models).
  - Added trained tiny-bert for QA evaluation. Model size is 18 MB.


## Installation
* Python version >= 3.6
* openai version >= 1.0


To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
pip install qa-metrics
```

## Usage/Logistics

The python package currently provides six QA evaluation methods. 
- Given a set of gold answers, a candidate answer to be evaluated, and a question (if applicable), the evaluation returns True if the candidate answer matches any one of the gold answer, False otherwise.
- Different evaluation methods have distinct strictness of evaluating the correctness of a candidate answer. Some have higher correlation with human judgments than others.
- Normalized Exact Match and Question/Answer type Evaluation are the most efficient method. They are suitable for short-form QA datasets such as NQ-OPEN, Hotpot QA, TriviaQA, SQuAD, etc.
- Question/Answer Type Evaluation and Transformer Neural evaluations are cost free and suitable for short-form and longer-form QA datasets. They have higher correlation with human judgments than exact match and F1 score when the length of the gold and candidate answers become long.
- Black-box LLM evaluations are closest to human evaluations, and they are not cost-free.

# Documentation

## Normalized Exact Match
#### `em_match`

Returns a boolean indicating whether there are any exact normalized matches between gold and candidate answers.

**Parameters**

- `reference_answer` (list of str): A list of gold (correct) answers to the question.
- `candidate_answer` (str): The answer provided by a candidate that needs to be evaluated.

**Returns**

- `boolean`: A boolean True/False signifying matches between reference or candidate answers.

```python
from qa_metrics.em import em_match

reference_answer = ["The Frog Prince", "The Princess and the Frog"]
candidate_answer = "The movie \"The Princess and the Frog\" is loosely based off the Brother Grimm's \"Iron Henry\""
match_result = em_match(reference_answer, candidate_answer)
print("Exact Match: ", match_result)
'''
Exact Match:  False
'''
```

## F1 Score
#### `f1_score_with_precision_recall`

Calculates F1 score, precision, and recall between a reference and a candidate answer.

**Parameters**

- `reference_answer` (str): A gold (correct) answers to the question.
- `candidate_answer` (str): The answer provided by a candidate that needs to be evaluated.

**Returns**

- `dictionary`: A dictionary containing the F1 score, precision, and recall between a gold and candidate answer.

```python
from qa_metrics.f1 import f1_match,f1_score_with_precision_recall

f1_stats = f1_score_with_precision_recall(reference_answer[0], candidate_answer)
print("F1 stats: ", f1_stats)
'''
F1 stats:  {'f1': 0.25, 'precision': 0.6666666666666666, 'recall': 0.15384615384615385}
'''

match_result = f1_match(reference_answer, candidate_answer, threshold=0.5)
print("F1 Match: ", match_result)
'''
F1 Match:  False
'''
```

## Efficient and Robust Question/Answer Type Evaluation
#### 1. `get_highest_score`

**Returns**

- `dictionary`: A dictionary containing the gold answer and candidate answer that have the highest matching score.

#### 2. `get_scores`

Returns all the gold answer and candidate answer pairs' matching scores.

**Parameters**

- `reference_answer` (list of str): A list of gold (correct) answers to the question.
- `candidate_answer` (str): The answer provided by a candidate that needs to be evaluated.
- `question` (str): The question for which the answers are being evaluated.

**Returns**

- `dictionary`: A dictionary containing gold answers and the candidate answer's matching score.

#### 3. `evaluate`

Returns True if the candidate answer is a match of any of the gold answers.

**Parameters**

- `reference_answer` (list of str): A list of gold (correct) answers to the question.
- `candidate_answer` (str): The answer provided by a candidate that needs to be evaluated.
- `question` (str): The question for which the answers are being evaluated.

**Returns**

- `boolean`: A boolean True/False signifying matches between reference or candidate answers.
